# spam-detector
In our project, we leverage machine learning and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to develop a robust spam detection system. By analyzing the textual content of messages, our model can accurately classify incoming messages as either spam or legitimate, helping users filter unwanted content from their communication channels.
